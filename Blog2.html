      <h1> GIS and it's uses</h1>
      <p class="firstgridtext-grey">GIS (geographic information systems) are software technologies that assist in the storage, retrieval, analysis and distribution of geographic data. This can include everything from satellite imagery to demographic databases to topographical maps. GIS is an enormously powerful tool for organisations that deal with high-volume spatial data, like real estate developers, insurance companies, telecommunication companies or government. GIS is helping map out the future of how we understand our world by better understanding the relationship between people, places and things.</p>
      <h5 class="Padding-32-First-grid">Where is GIS used?</h5>
      <p class="firstgridtext-grey"> GIS can be used for many purposes. It can be used for tracking population, economic development, and natural hazards. GIS can also be used for retail site selection, insurance mapping and telecommunications. GIS and digital mapping is used daily as part of web mapping apps, finding your favourite store or locating where your friends are in your favourite social media app.</p>
	  <h5 class="Padding-32-First-grid">1. Mapping Visualisation</h5>
    <p class="firstgridtext-grey">GIS can be used to provide a visual interpretation of data. Google Maps is an excellent example of a web-based GIS mapping solution. </p>
    <h5 class="Padding-32-First-grid">2. Telecom and Network Management</h5>
    <p class="firstgridtext-grey">Telecom companies use GIS to better plan, design and manage their Telecom networks. 5G rollouts rely heavily on the use of GIS to maximise the coverage and pinpoint where networks are needed. </p>
    <h5 class="Padding-32-First-grid">3. Policing and Emergency Services</h5>
    <p class="firstgridtext-grey">GIS helps to model and analyse crime data and better plan deployment of resources. </p>
    <h5 class="Padding-32-First-grid">4. Urban planning / Government</h5>
    <p class="firstgridtext-grey">Governments use GIS for urban growth planning and allocation of resources. GIS is used across all levels of government in health, emergencies, urban planning and smart cities. </p>
    <h5 class="Padding-32-First-grid">5. Transportation Planning</h5>
    <p class="firstgridtext-grey">GIS data is commonly used for managing transportation. With the addition of environmental and and real time data in a GIS platform routes can be optimised and last mile deliveries streamlined.</p>

      <h1>What are some of the industries that use GIS?</h1>
      <p class="secondgridtext-grey">GIS is used by a wide range of industries. It can be found in organizations such as the military, government agencies, companies that do environmental work, engineering firms, insurance companies, telecommunications and more. Technology has greatly improved GIS so it's also being used in fields like meteorology and anthropology. This type of information is put into maps to identify spatial patterns.</p>
      <h5 class="secondgridpadding-32">What is Spatial Data?</h5>
      <p class="secondgridtext-grey">Spatial data can be information that is on - or near - Earth's surface: geography, topography, and hydrography. Spatial data also includes information about man-made features and natural features. A related term is geoinformation.</p>
      <h5 class="secondgridpadding-32">How can GIS help businesses?</h5>
      <p class="secondgridtext-grey">GIS stands for Geographic Information Systems. It is a software that allows you to map out your business. Geographic Information Systems are being used widely by businesses that need to target locations for new stores or identify where their next potential customer is located. You can pinpoint where your clients are, how they are getting to your business, and what they want. GIS is vital for many types of businesses because it provides data on areas that weren't previously accessible by other means.</p>
      <h5 class="secondgridpadding-32">What is Location Intelligence?</h5>
      <p class="secondgridtext-grey">Location intelligence is the process of analysing location data to identify patterns. People use it for all sorts of things, like marketing campaigns, urban planning, and disaster response. It can be used to answer questions like “How can we increase foot traffic in this store?”
          Powerful GIS software like MapInfo Professional helps organisations make better and faster decisions where location is a critical factor.
          In summary, GIS is an exciting technology that unlocks the relationship between your business information and the world around us. More and more businesses are utilising GIS and Spatial Data to make better, faster and more accurate decisions.</p>
